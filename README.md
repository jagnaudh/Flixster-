### Notes

Initially I had trouble creating and connecting new ViewControllers with MainStoryboard. However, after re-watching the walkthrough tutorials I was able to complete all the required user stories.
I will begin working on the Bonus user stories as soon as I figure out Autolayout and update this Readme. 

Time taken to complete Part 1: 3 hours
